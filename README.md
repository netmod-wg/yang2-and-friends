# YANG 2.0

This is the repository for the document `draft-yn-netmod-yang2`
(The YANG 2.0 Data Modeling Language).

The initial goal is to make the document not be XML or NETCONF specific,
thus setting a baseline for subsequent changes.  This is accomplished by:
  - removing the "XML Encoding Rules" sections.
  - removing the "NETCONF &ltl;edit-config&gt; Operations" sections.
  - removing the "NETCONF XML Encoding Rules" sections.
  - removing the "Example Usage" sections.
  - making remaining examples be both XML and JSON.

XML-specific text moves to `draft-yn-netmod-yang-xml` (XML Encoding
of Data Modeled with YANG).
