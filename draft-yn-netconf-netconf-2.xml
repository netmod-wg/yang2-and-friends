      <t>
The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) defined in this document
provides mechanisms to install, manipulate, and delete the
configuration of network devices. It uses an Extensible Markup
Language (XML)-based data encoding for the configuration data as well
as the protocol messages. The NETCONF protocol operations are realized
as remote procedure calls (RPCs).  This document obsoletes RFC 4741.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The NETCONF protocol defines a simple mechanism through
which a network device can be managed, configuration data
information can be retrieved, and new configuration data can be
uploaded and manipulated. The protocol allows the device to expose a
full, formal application programming interface (API). Applications
can use this straightforward API to send and receive full and partial
configuration data sets.
      </t>
      <t>
The NETCONF protocol uses a remote procedure call (RPC) paradigm.
A client encodes an RPC in XML
<xref target="W3C.REC-xml-20001006" format="default"/> and
sends it to a server using a secure, connection-oriented
session. The server responds with a reply encoded in XML. The contents
of both the request and the response are fully described in XML DTDs
or XML schemas, or both, allowing both parties to recognize the
syntax constraints imposed on the exchange.
      </t>
      <t>
A key aspect of NETCONF is that it allows the functionality of the
management protocol to closely mirror the native functionality of
the device.  This reduces implementation costs
and allows timely access to new features.  In addition, applications
can access both the syntactic and semantic content of
the device's native user interface.
      </t>
      <t>
NETCONF allows a client to discover the set of protocol
extensions supported by a server. These "capabilities" permit the
client to adjust its behavior to take advantage of the features
exposed by the device. The capability definitions can be easily
extended in a noncentralized manner. Standard and non-standard
capabilities can be defined with semantic and syntactic rigor.
Capabilities are discussed in <xref target="capabilities" format="default"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
The NETCONF protocol is a building block in a system of automated
configuration. XML is the lingua franca of interchange, providing a
flexible but fully specified encoding mechanism for hierarchical
content. NETCONF can be used in concert with XML-based transformation
technologies, such as XSLT <xref target="W3C.REC-xslt-19991116" format="default"/>,
to provide a system for automated generation of
full and partial configurations.
The system can query one or more databases for data about networking
topologies, links, policies, customers, and services.  This data can
be transformed using one or more XSLT
scripts from a task-oriented,
vendor-independent data schema into a form that
is specific to the vendor, product, operating system, and software
release. The resulting data can be passed to the device using the
NETCONF protocol.

        <t>
NETCONF uses a simple RPC-based mechanism to facilitate communication
between a client and a server.  The client can be a script or
application typically running as part of a network manager.  The
server is typically
a network device. The terms "device" and "server" are used
interchangeably in this document, as are "client" and "application".
        </t>
        <t>
A NETCONF session is the logical connection between a network administrator or
network configuration application and a network device.
A device MUST support at least one NETCONF session and
SHOULD support multiple sessions.
Global configuration attributes can be changed 
during any authorized session, and the effects are visible in all sessions.
Session-specific attributes affect only the session in which
they are changed.
        </t>
        <t>
					NETCONF can be conceptually partitioned into four layers as
					shown in <xref target="layers" format="default"/>.

        <name>Separation of Configuration and State Data</name>
        <t>
          The information that can be retrieved from a running system is
          separated into two classes, configuration data and state
          data. Configuration data is the set of writable data that is required
          to transform a system from its initial default state into its current
          state. State data is the additional data on a system that is not
          configuration data such as read-only status information and collected
          statistics. When a device is performing configuration operations, a
          number of problems would arise if state data were
          included:

        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>Comparisons of configuration data sets would be dominated by irrelevant
              entries such as different statistics.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Incoming data could contain nonsensical
            requests, such as attempts to write read-only data.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>The data sets would be large.</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Archived data could contain values for read-only data
              items, complicating the processing required to restore
              archived data.
            </t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          To account for these issues, the NETCONF protocol recognizes the difference
          between configuration data and state data and provides
          operations for
          each. The &lt;get‑config&gt; operation
          retrieves configuration data only, while the &lt;get&gt; operation
          retrieves configuration and state data.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note that the NETCONF protocol is focused on the information
          required to get the device into its desired running state.
          The inclusion of other important, persistent data is
          implementation specific.  For example, user files and
          databases are not treated as configuration data by the NETCONF
          protocol. 
        </t>
        <t>
          For example, if a local database of user authentication 
          data is stored on the device, it is an
          implementation-dependent matter
          whether it is included in configuration data.

    <t>
This document defines the following mechanism for announcing
conformance information.  Other mechanisms may be defined by future
specifications.
    </t>
    <t>
        A NETCONF server MUST announce the modules it implements <!-- FIXME after DT upload: (see
<xref relative="implementing" target="I.D.yn-netmod-yang-2"/>) --> by implementing the YANG module
&quot;ietf&#8209;yang&#8209;library&quot; defined in
<xref target="RFC8525"/> and listing all implemented modules in
the &quot;/modules&#8209;state/module&quot; list.
    </t>
    <t>
The server also MUST advertise the following capability in the &lt;hello&gt;
message (line breaks and whitespaces are used for formatting reasons
only):
    </t>

        <figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[
  urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:yang-library:1.0?
    revision=<date>&module-set-id=<id>
            ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
    <t>
The parameter &quot;revision&quot; has the same value as the revision date of
the &quot;ietf&#8209;yang&#8209;library&quot; module implemented by the server.  This
parameter MUST be present.
    </t>
    <t>
The parameter &quot;module&#8209;set&#8209;id&quot; has the same value as the leaf
&quot;/modules&#8209;state/module&#8209;set&#8209;id&quot; from &quot;ietf&#8209;yang&#8209;library&quot;.  This
parameter MUST be present.
    </t>
    <t>
With this mechanism, a client can cache the supported modules for a
server and only update the cache if the &quot;module&#8209;set&#8209;id&quot; value in the
&lt;hello&gt; message changes.

        <section title="From Section 7.5.8 (NETCONF &lt;edit-config&gt; Operations, for containers)">
    <t>
Containers can be created, deleted, replaced, and modified through
&lt;edit&#8209;config&gt; by using the &quot;operation&quot; attribute
(see Section&nbsp;7.2 in <xref target="RFC6241"/>) in the
container&apos;s XML element.
    </t>
    <t>
If a container does not have a &quot;presence&quot; statement and the last child
node is deleted, the NETCONF server MAY delete the container.

When a NETCONF server processes an &lt;edit&#8209;config&gt; request, the
elements of procedure for the container node are as follows:
    </t>
<ul>
 <li>
If the operation is &quot;merge&quot; or &quot;replace&quot;, the node is created if it
does not exist.

 <li>
If the operation is &quot;create&quot;, the node is created if it does not
exist.  If the node already exists, a &quot;data&#8209;exists&quot; error is
returned.

    <t>
In an &quot;ordered-by user&quot; leaf-list, the attributes &quot;insert&quot; and &quot;value&quot;
in the YANG XML namespace (<xref target="yang-namespace"/>) can be used to control where
in the leaf-list the entry is inserted.  These can be used during
&quot;create&quot; operations to insert a new leaf-list entry, or during &quot;merge&quot;
or &quot;replace&quot; operations to insert a new leaf-list entry or move an
existing one.
    </t>

The &quot;insert&quot; attribute can take the values &quot;first&quot;, &quot;last&quot;, &quot;before&quot;,
and &quot;after&quot;.  If the value is &quot;before&quot; or &quot;after&quot;, the &quot;value&quot;
attribute MUST also be used to specify an existing entry in the
leaf&nbhy;list.

In a &lt;copy&#8209;config&gt; or in an &lt;edit&#8209;config&gt; with a &quot;replace&quot; operation

      <name>Transport Protocol Requirements</name>
      <t>NETCONF uses an RPC-based communication paradigm. A client
        sends a series of one or more RPC request messages, which
        cause the server to respond with a corresponding series of
        RPC reply messages.
      </t>
      <t>The NETCONF protocol can be layered on any transport protocol that
        provides the required set of functionality. It is not bound to
        any particular transport protocol, but allows a mapping to define how it
        can be implemented over any specific protocol.
      </t>
      <t>
        The transport protocol MUST provide a mechanism to indicate the
        session type (client or server) to the NETCONF protocol layer.
      </t>
      <t>
        This section details the characteristics that NETCONF requires

        <name>Connection-Oriented Operation</name>
        <t>NETCONF is connection-oriented, requiring a persistent
        connection between peers. This connection MUST provide
        reliable, sequenced data delivery.  NETCONF connections are
        long-lived, persisting between protocol operations.
        </t>
        <t> In addition, resources requested from the server for a
          particular connection MUST be automatically released when the
          connection closes, making failure recovery simpler and more
          robust. For example, when a lock is acquired by a client, the
          lock persists until either it is explicitly released or the server
          determines that the connection has been terminated. If a
          connection is terminated while the client holds a lock, the
          server can perform any appropriate recovery.
          The &lt;lock&gt; operation is further discussed in <xref target="lock" format="default"/>.

      <section numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Authentication, Integrity, and Confidentiality</name>
        <t>
					NETCONF connections MUST provide authentication, data
					integrity, confidentiality, and replay protection. NETCONF
					depends on the transport protocol for this capability. A
					NETCONF peer assumes that appropriate levels of security and
					confidentiality are provided independently of this
					document. For example, connections could be encrypted using
					Transport Layer Security (TLS)
					<xref target="RFC5246" format="default"/> or Secure Shell (SSH) <xref target="RFC4251" format="default"/>,
					depending on the underlying protocol.
        </t>
        <t>
					NETCONF connections MUST be authenticated. The transport
					protocol is responsible for authentication of the server to
					the client and authentication of the client to the server. A
					NETCONF peer assumes that the connection's authentication
					information has been validated by the underlying transport
					protocol using sufficiently trustworthy mechanisms and that
					the peer's identity has been sufficiently proven.
        </t>
        <t>
					One goal of NETCONF is to provide a programmatic interface
					to the device that closely follows the functionality of the
					device's native interface. Therefore, it is expected that
					the underlying protocol uses existing authentication
					mechanisms available on the device. For example, a NETCONF
					server on a device that supports RADIUS
					<xref target="RFC2865" format="default"/> might allow the use of RADIUS to
					authenticate NETCONF sessions.
        </t>
        <t>
					The authentication process MUST result in an authenticated
					client identity whose permissions are known to the server.
					The authenticated identity of a client is commonly referred
					to as the NETCONF username. The username is a string of
					characters that match the "Char" production from Section 2.2
					of <xref target="W3C.REC-xml-20001006" format="default"/>.  The algorithm
					used to derive the username is transport protocol specific
					and in addition specific to the authentication mechanism
					used by the transport protocol.  The transport protocol MUST

        The NETCONF protocol uses an RPC-based communication
        model. NETCONF peers use &lt;rpc&gt; and &lt;rpc‑reply&gt;
        elements to provide transport-protocol-independent framing of
        NETCONF requests and responses.

          The &lt;rpc&gt; element is used to enclose a NETCONF request sent from
          the client to the server.
        </t>
        <t>
					The &lt;rpc&gt; element has a mandatory attribute
					"message-id", which is a string chosen by the sender of the
					RPC that will commonly encode a monotonically increasing
					integer. The receiver of the RPC does not decode or
					interpret this string but simply saves it to be used as a
					"message-id" attribute in any resulting
					&lt;rpc‑reply&gt; message. The sender MUST ensure that
					the "message-id" value is normalized according to the XML
					attribute value normalization rules defined in
					<xref target="W3C.REC-xml-20001006" format="default"/> if the sender wants
					the string to be returned unmodified. For example:

          If additional attributes are present in an &lt;rpc&gt;

          attributes.

        <t>
The name and parameters of an RPC are encoded as the contents

        <t>NETCONF defines the existence of one or more configuration
          datastores and allows configuration operations on them.
          A configuration datastore is defined as
          the complete set of configuration data that is required to get a
          device from its initial default state into a desired operational state.
          The configuration datastore does not include state data or executive
          commands.
        </t>
        <t>
          The running configuration datastore holds the complete
          configuration currently active on the network device.  Only
          one configuration datastore of this type exists on the
          device, and it is always present. NETCONF protocol
          operations refer to this datastore using the &lt;running&gt;
          element.
        </t>
        <t>
          Only the &lt;running&gt; configuration datastore is present in the
          base model. Additional configuration datastores MAY be
          defined by capabilities. Such configuration datastores
          are available only on devices that advertise the
          capabilities.
        </t>
        <t>
          The capabilities in Sections
          <xref target="candidate" format="counter"/> and <xref target="startup" format="counter"/>

          Data modeling and content issues are outside the scope of
          the NETCONF protocol.  An assumption is made that the
          device's data model is well-known to the application and
          that both parties are aware of issues such as the layout,
          containment, keying, lookup, replacement, and management
          of the data, as well as any other constraints imposed by
          the data model.
        </t>
        <t>
          NETCONF carries configuration data inside the &lt;config&gt; element
          that is specific to the device's data model.  The protocol treats the
          contents of that element as opaque data.  The device uses
          capabilities to announce the set of data models that the
          device implements.  The capability definition details the
          operation and constraints imposed by data model.

        <t>
          XML subtree filtering is a mechanism that allows an application to
          select particular XML subtrees to include in the &lt;rpc‑reply&gt; for a
          &lt;get&gt; or &lt;get‑config&gt; operation.  A small set of filters for
          inclusion, simple content exact-match, and selection is provided,
          which allows some useful, but also very limited, selection mechanisms.
          The server does not need to utilize any data-model-specific semantics
          during processing, allowing for simple and centralized implementation
          strategies.
        </t>
        <t>
          Conceptually, a subtree filter is comprised of zero or more element
          subtrees, which represent the filter selection criteria.  At each
          containment level within a subtree, the set of sibling nodes is
          logically processed by the server to determine if its subtree and
          path of elements to the root are included in the filter output.
        </t>
        <t>
          Each node specified in a subtree filter represents an inclusive
          filter.  Only associated nodes in underlying data model(s) within
          the specified datastore on the server are selected 
          by the filter.  A node is selected if it matches the
          selection criteria and hierarchy of elements
          given in the filter data, except that the filter absolute path name is 
          adjusted to start from the layer below &lt;filter&gt;.  
        </t>
        <t>
          Response messages contain only the subtrees selected by the filter.
          Any selection criteria that were present in the request, within a
          particular selected subtree, are also included in the response.
          Note that some elements expressed in the filter as leaf nodes
          will be expanded (i.e., subtrees included) in the filter output.
          Specific data instances are not duplicated in the response in the
          event that the request contains multiple filter subtree
					expressions that
          select the same data.

        <t>
          A subtree filter is comprised of XML elements and their XML
          attributes.  There are five types of components that can be 
          present in a subtree filter:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <t>Namespace Selection</t>

            <t>Attribute Match Expressions</t>

          <li>
            <t>Containment Nodes</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Selection Nodes</t>
          </li>
          <li>
            <t>Content Match Nodes</t>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <section anchor="NamespaceSelection" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Namespace Selection</name>
          <t>
            A namespace is considered
            to match (for filter purposes) if the XML namespace associated
            with a particular node within the &lt;filter&gt; element is the same
            as in the underlying data model.
            Note that namespace selection cannot be used by itself.
            At least one element MUST be specified in the filter
            if any elements are to be included in the filter output.
          </t>
          <t>
            An XML namespace wildcard mechanism is defined for subtree
            filtering. If an element 
            within the &lt;filter&gt; element
            is not qualified by a namespace (e.g., xmlns=""),
            then the server MUST evaluate all the XML namespaces it
            supports, when processing that subtree filter node.
            This wildcard mechanism is not applicable to XML attributes.
          </t>
          <t>
            Note that prefix values
            for qualified namespaces are not relevant when comparing filter 
            elements to elements in the underlying data model.
          </t>

  </filter>
              ]]></artwork>
          <t>
            In this example, the &lt;top&gt; element is a selection
            node, and only this node in the
            "http://example.com/schema/1.2/config" namespace and any
            child nodes (from the underlying data model) will be
            included in the filter output.

          <name>Attribute Match Expressions</name>
          <t>
            An attribute that appears in a subtree filter is part of
            an "attribute match expression".  Any number of (unqualified 
            or qualified) XML attributes MAY be present in any type of 
            filter node.  In addition to the selection criteria normally 
            applicable to that node, the selected data MUST have matching 
            values for every attribute specified in the node.  If an element 
            is not defined to include a specified attribute, then it is not 
            selected in the filter output.
          </t>

          <t>
            In this example, the &lt;top&gt; and &lt;interfaces&gt;
            elements are containment nodes, the &lt;interface&gt;
            element is a selection node, and "ifName" is an attribute
            match expression.  Only "interface" nodes in the
            "http://example.com/schema/1.2/config" namespace that have
            an "ifName" attribute with the value "eth0" and occur
            within "interfaces" nodes within "top" nodes will be

          <t>
            Nodes that contain child elements within a subtree filter
            are called "containment nodes".  Each child element can be
            any type of node, including another containment node.  For
            each containment node specified in a subtree filter, all
            data model instances that exactly match the specified

            An empty leaf node within a filter is called a "selection node",
            and it represents an "explicit selection" filter on the underlying
            data model.  Presence of any selection nodes within a set of sibling
            nodes will cause the filter to select the specified subtree(s)
            and suppress automatic selection of the entire set of sibling nodes
            in the underlying data model.  For filtering purposes, an empty
            leaf node can be declared either with an empty tag (e.g., &lt;foo/&gt;) 
            or with explicit start and end tags (e.g., &lt;foo&gt;  &lt;/foo&gt;).  Any
            whitespace characters are ignored in this form.

            nodes in the

            A leaf node that contains simple content is called a "content

            nodes for filter output, and it represents an exact-match filter on 
            the leaf node element content.  The following constraints apply to

          Each subtree filter can contain one or more data model fragments,

          (with all child nodes) in the filter output.
        </t>
        <t>
          Each subtree data fragment is compared by the server to the internal
          data models supported by the server.  If the entire subtree
          data-fragment filter (starting from the root to the innermost element
          specified in the filter) exactly matches a corresponding portion of

          (or potentially included) in the filter output, and which sibling
          subtrees are excluded (pruned) from the filter output.  The server
          first determines which types of nodes are present in the sibling set
          and processes the nodes according to the rules for their type.  If
          any nodes in the sibling set are selected, then the process is
          recursively applied to the sibling sets of each selected node.  The
          algorithm continues until all sibling sets in all subtrees specified

            error.  The &lt;filter&gt; element's "type" attribute used in these
            examples is discussed further in Section 7.1.

            The filter in this example contains one selection node (&lt;users&gt;), so
            just that subtree is selected by the filter.  This example represents
            the fully populated &lt;users&gt; data model in most of the filter examples
            that follow.  In a real data model, the &lt;company‑info&gt; would not
            likely be returned with the list of users for a particular host or
            network.

      <name>Protocol Operations</name>
      <t>
        The NETCONF protocol provides a small set of low-level 
        operations to manage device configurations and retrieve device state
        information. The base protocol provides operations to retrieve,
        configure, copy, and delete configuration datastores.  Additional
        operations are provided, based on the capabilities advertised by the
        device.
      </t>
      <t>
        The base protocol includes the following protocol operations:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>get</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>get-config</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>edit-config</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>copy-config</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>delete-config</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>lock</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>unlock</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>close-session</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>kill-session</t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>
A protocol operation can fail for various reasons,
including "operation not supported".  An initiator SHOULD
NOT assume that any operation will always succeed.  The return
values in any RPC reply SHOULD be checked for error responses.
      </t>
      <t>
The syntax and XML encoding of the protocol operations are 
formally defined in the YANG module in <xref target="yangmodule" format="default"/>.
The following sections describe the semantics of each protocol operation.

        The &lt;filter&gt; element MAY optionally contain a "type" attribute.
        This attribute indicates the type of filtering syntax used within

        referred to as subtree filtering and is described in

            <t>
The &lt;edit‑config&gt; operation loads all or part of a specified
configuration to the specified target configuration datastore.  This
operation allows the new configuration to be expressed in
several ways, such as using a local file, a remote file, or
inline.  If the target configuration datastore does not exist, it will be
created.

            </t>
            <t>
If a NETCONF peer supports <xref target="url" format="default">the :url capability</xref>,
the &lt;url&gt; element can appear instead of the &lt;config&gt; parameter.

            </t>
            <t>
The device analyzes the source and target configurations and
performs the requested changes.  The target configuration is not
necessarily
replaced, as with the &lt;copy‑config&gt; message.  Instead, the
target configuration is changed in accordance with the source's
data and requested operations.
            </t>
            <t>
If the &lt;edit‑config&gt; operation contains multiple sub-operations
that apply to the same conceptual node in the underlying
data model, then the result of the operation is undefined
(i.e., outside the scope of the NETCONF protocol).

                    Elements in the &lt;config&gt; subtree MAY contain an
                    "operation" attribute, which belongs to the NETCONF 
 namespace defined in <xref target="namespace" format="default"/>. The attribute identifies the point in
                    the configuration to perform the operation and
                    MAY appear on multiple elements throughout the
                    &lt;config&gt; subtree.

                        incoming configuration data uses the "operation" attribute to

                        Using "none" allows operations like "delete" to avoid
                        unintentionally creating the parent hierarchy of the element to
                        be deleted.

    Create or replace an entire

Even if it advertises the :writable-running capability,

A device MAY choose not to support remote-to-remote copy operations,

The &lt;lock&gt; operation allows the client to lock the entire configuration
datastore system of a device. Such locks are intended to be
short-lived and allow a client to make a change without fear of
interaction with other NETCONF clients, non-NETCONF clients (e.g.,
SNMP and command line interface (CLI) scripts), and human users.

            </t>
            <t>

An attempt to lock the configuration datastore MUST fail if an existing
session or other entity holds a lock on any portion of the
lock target.

            </t>
            <t>

When the lock is acquired, the server MUST prevent any changes to the
locked resource other than those requested by this session.
SNMP and CLI requests to modify the resource MUST
fail with an appropriate error.

            </t>
            <t>

The duration of the lock is defined as beginning when the lock is
acquired and lasting until either the lock is released or the NETCONF
session closes. The session closure can be explicitly performed by the
client, or implicitly performed by the server based on criteria such
as failure of the underlying transport, simple inactivity timeout, or
detection of abusive behavior on the part of the client. These
criteria are dependent on the implementation and the underlying
transport.

            </t>
            <t>
   The &lt;lock&gt; operation takes a mandatory parameter, &lt;target&gt;.
   The &lt;target&gt; parameter names the configuration datastore that will
   be locked.
   When a lock is active, using the &lt;edit‑config&gt; operation
   on the locked
   configuration datastore and using the locked configuration as a target of the
   &lt;copy‑config&gt; operation will be disallowed by any other
   NETCONF session.
   Additionally, the system
   will ensure that these locked configuration resources will not be
   modified by other non-NETCONF management operations such as SNMP and
   CLI. The &lt;kill‑session&gt; operation can be used to
   force
   the release of a lock owned by another NETCONF session.  It
   is beyond the scope of this document to define how to break
   locks held by other entities.

    <section anchor="capabilities" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Capabilities</name>
      <t>
This section defines a set of capabilities that a client or a server MAY
implement.
Each peer advertises its capabilities by
sending them during an initial capabilities exchange. Each peer
needs to understand only those capabilities that it might use and MUST
ignore any capability received from the other
peer that it does not require or does not understand.
      </t>
      <t>
Additional capabilities can be defined using the template in
<xref target="capabilityTemplate" format="default"/>.
Future capability definitions can be published as standards by
standards bodies or published as proprietary extensions.
      </t>
      <t>
A NETCONF capability is identified with a URI.
The base capabilities are defined using URNs following
the method described in <xref target="RFC3553" format="default">RFC 3553</xref>.
Capabilities defined in this document have the following format:
      </t>
      <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:{name}:1.x</t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>
where {name} is the name of the capability. Capabilities are often
referenced in discussions and email using the shorthand :{name}, or
:{name}:{version} if the capability exists in multiple versions. For
example, the foo capability would have the formal name
"urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:foo:1.0" and be called ":foo". The
shorthand form MUST NOT be used inside the protocol.
      </t>
      <section anchor="capabilityExchange" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Capabilities Exchange</name>
        <t>
Capabilities are advertised in messages sent 
by each peer during session establishment. When the NETCONF session is
opened, each peer (both client and server) MUST send a &lt;hello&gt;
element containing a list of that peer's capabilities. 
Each peer MUST send at least the base NETCONF capability,
"urn:ietf:params:netconf:base:1.1".  A peer MAY include
capabilities for previous NETCONF versions, to indicate that
it supports multiple protocol versions.
        </t>
        <t>
Both NETCONF peers MUST verify that the other peer has advertised
a common protocol version.  When comparing protocol version capability
URIs, only the base part is used, in the event any parameters are encoded
at the end of the URI string.  If no protocol version capability in
common is found, the NETCONF peer MUST NOT continue the session.
If more than one protocol version URI in common is present, then
the highest numbered (most recent) protocol version MUST be used
by both peers.
        </t>
        <t>
A server sending the &lt;hello&gt; element
MUST include a &lt;session‑id&gt; element containing the
session ID for this NETCONF session.
A client sending the &lt;hello&gt; element MUST NOT
include a &lt;session‑id&gt; element.
        </t>
        <t>
A server receiving a &lt;hello&gt; message with a
&lt;session‑id&gt; element MUST terminate the NETCONF session.
Similarly, a client that does not receive a &lt;session‑id&gt;
element in the server's &lt;hello&gt; message MUST terminate the NETCONF
session (without first sending a &lt;close‑session&gt;).
        </t>
        <t>
In the following example, a server advertises the base NETCONF capability,
one NETCONF capability defined in the base NETCONF document, and one
implementation-specific capability.

        <t>
Each peer sends its &lt;hello&gt; element simultaneously as soon as the
connection is open. A peer MUST NOT wait to receive the capability set
from the other side before sending its own set.

        <section numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Description</name>
          <t>
The candidate configuration capability, :candidate, indicates that
the device supports a candidate configuration datastore, which is used to hold
configuration data that can be manipulated without impacting the device's
current configuration.  The candidate configuration is a full
configuration data set that serves as a work place for creating and
manipulating configuration data.  Additions, deletions, and changes
can be made to this data to construct the desired configuration
data. A &lt;commit&gt; operation MAY be performed
at any time that causes the device's running configuration to be
set to the value of the candidate configuration.
          </t>
          <t>
            The &lt;commit&gt; operation effectively sets the running
            configuration to the current contents of the candidate configuration.
            While it could be modeled as a simple copy, it is done as a distinct
            operation for a number of reasons.  In keeping high-level concepts
            as first-class operations, we allow developers to see more clearly
            both what the client is requesting and what the server must perform.
            This keeps the intentions more obvious, the special cases less complex,
            and the interactions between operations more straightforward.  For
            example, the <xref target="confirmed" format="default">:confirmed-commit:1.1 capability </xref>
            would make no sense as a "copy confirmed" operation.
          </t>
          <t>
   The candidate configuration can be shared among multiple
   sessions. Unless a client has specific information that the
   candidate configuration is not shared, it MUST assume
   that other sessions are able to
   modify the candidate configuration at the same time. It is
   therefore prudent for a client to lock the candidate configuration
   before modifying it.
          </t>
          <t>
   The client can discard any uncommitted changes to the candidate
   configuration by executing the &lt;discard‑changes&gt; operation.  This
   operation reverts the contents of the candidate configuration
   to the contents of the running configuration.

When the candidate configuration's content is complete, the

The &lt;commit&gt; operation instructs the device to implement the
configuration data contained in the candidate configuration.
If the device is unable to commit all of the changes in the candidate
configuration datastore, then the running configuration MUST
remain unchanged.  If the device does succeed in committing, the
running configuration MUST be updated with the contents of the
candidate configuration.

any outstanding changes are discarded when the lock is released,

          <name>Description</name>
          <t>
The :confirmed-commit:1.1 capability indicates that the server will
support the &lt;cancel‑commit&gt; operation and the
&lt;confirmed&gt;, &lt;confirm‑timeout&gt;, &lt;persist&gt;, and
&lt;persist‑id&gt; parameters for the &lt;commit&gt;
operation. See <xref target="candidate" format="default"/> for further details on the
&lt;commit&gt; operation.
</t>
          <t>
	A confirmed &lt;commit&gt; operation MUST be reverted if a confirming commit
	is not issued within the timeout period (by default 600 seconds = 10
	minutes).  The confirming commit is a &lt;commit&gt; operation without the
	&lt;confirmed&gt; parameter.  The timeout period can be adjusted
	with the &lt;confirm‑timeout&gt; parameter.  If a follow-up
	confirmed &lt;commit&gt; operation is issued before the timer expires, the
	timer is reset to the new value (600 seconds by default).  Both the
	confirming commit and a follow-up confirmed &lt;commit&gt; operation MAY
	introduce additional changes to the configuration.
</t>
          <t>
  If the &lt;persist&gt; element is not given in the confirmed commit
  operation, any follow-up commit and the confirming commit MUST be
  issued on the same session that issued the confirmed commit.  If the
  &lt;persist&gt; element is given in the confirmed &lt;commit&gt; operation,
  a follow-up commit and the confirming commit can be given on any
  session, and they MUST include a &lt;persist‑id&gt; element
  with a value equal to the given value of the &lt;persist&gt;
  element.
</t>
          <t>
If the server also advertises the :startup capability, a
&lt;copy‑config&gt; from running to startup is also necessary to
save the changes to startup.
</t>
          <t>
If the session issuing the confirmed commit is terminated for any
reason before the confirm timeout expires, the server MUST restore the
configuration to its state before the confirmed commit was issued,
unless the confirmed commit also included a &lt;persist&gt; element.
</t>
          <t>
If the device reboots for any reason before the confirm timeout expires,
the server MUST restore the configuration to its state before the 
confirmed commit was issued.
</t>
          <t>
If a confirming commit is not issued, the device will revert its
configuration to the state prior to the issuance of the confirmed
commit.  To cancel a confirmed commit and revert changes without
waiting for the confirm timeout to expire, the client can explicitly
restore the configuration to its state before the confirmed commit was
issued, by using the &lt;cancel‑commit&gt; operation.
</t>
          <t>
For shared configurations, this feature can cause other
configuration changes (for example, via other NETCONF sessions) to be
inadvertently altered or removed, unless the configuration locking
feature is used (in other words, the lock is obtained before the &lt;edit‑config&gt;
operation is started). Therefore, it is strongly suggested that in
order to use this feature with shared configuration datastores,
configuration locking SHOULD also be used.
</t>
          <t>
						 Version 1.0 of this capability was defined in <xref target="RFC4741" format="default"/>.  Version 1.1 is
						 defined in this document, and extends version 1.0 by
						 adding a new operation, &lt;cancel‑commit&gt;, and
						 two new optional parameters, &lt;persist&gt; and
						 &lt;persist‑id&gt;. For backwards compatibility
						 with old clients, servers conforming to this
						 specification MAY advertise version 1.0 in addition to
						 version 1.1.

             Validation consists of checking a complete
             configuration for syntactical and semantic errors before
             applying the configuration to the device.
          </t>
          <t>
 If this capability is advertised, the device supports the
 &lt;validate&gt; protocol operation and checks at least for syntax
 errors. In addition, this capability supports the &lt;test-option&gt; parameter to the
 &lt;edit‑config&gt; operation and, when it is provided, checks at
 least for syntax errors.



          </t>
          <t>
						 Version 1.0 of this capability was defined in <xref target="RFC4741" format="default"/>.  Version 1.1 is
						 defined in this document, and extends version 1.0 by
						 adding a new value, "test-only", to the &lt;test-option&gt;
						 parameter of the &lt;edit‑config&gt; operation.  For backwards
						 compatibility with old clients, servers conforming to this
						 specification MAY advertise version 1.0 in addition to
						 version 1.1.

          <t>
             The XPath capability indicates that the NETCONF
             peer supports the use of XPath expressions in the
             &lt;filter&gt; element.
             XPath is described in <xref target="W3C.REC-xpath-19991116" format="default"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
             The data model used in the XPath expression is the same
             as that used in XPath 1.0 <xref target="W3C.REC-xpath-19991116" format="default"/>, with the same
             extension for root node children as used by XSLT 1.0
             (<xref target="W3C.REC-xslt-19991116" format="default"/>, Section 3.1).
             Specifically, it means that the root node MAY have any
             number of element nodes as its children.
          </t>
          <t>The XPath expression is evaluated in the following context:
          </t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>
              <t>The set of namespace declarations are those in
						 scope on the &lt;filter&gt; element.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>The set of variable bindings is defined by the data
						 model.  If no such variable bindings are defined, the set
						 is empty.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>The function library is the core function library,
						 plus any functions defined by the data model.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>The context node is the root node.</t>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <t>
             The XPath expression MUST return a node set.  If it does
             not return a node set, the operation fails with an
             "invalid-value" error.
          </t>
          <t>
						 The response message contains the subtrees selected by
						 the filter expression.  For each such subtree, the path
						 from the data model root node down to the subtree,
						 including any elements or attributes necessary to

    The :xpath capability modifies the &lt;get&gt; and &lt;get‑config&gt; operations
   to accept the value "xpath" in the "type" attribute of the &lt;filter&gt;
   element.  When the "type" attribute is set to "xpath", a "select"
   attribute MUST be present on the &lt;filter&gt; element.  The "select"
   attribute will be treated as an XPath expression and used to filter
   the returned data.  The &lt;filter&gt; element itself MUST be empty in this
   case.
            </t>
            <t>
   The XPath result for the select expression MUST be a node-set.
   Each node in the node-set MUST correspond to a node in
   the underlying data model.  In order to properly identify
   each node, the following encoding rules are defined:

        contains only fully specified subtrees, according
        to the underlying data model.</t>
              </li>
              <li>
                <t>If any sibling or ancestor nodes of the result node are needed to
        identify a particular instance within a conceptual data structure,
        then these nodes MUST also be encoded in the response.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
This section provides security considerations for the base NETCONF
message layer and the base operations of the NETCONF
protocol.  Security considerations for the NETCONF transports are
provided in the transport documents, and security considerations for
the content manipulated by NETCONF can be found in the documents
defining data models.</t>
      <t>
This document does not specify an authorization scheme, as 
such a scheme will likely be tied to a meta-data model or a
data model.  Implementors SHOULD provide a comprehensive
authorization scheme with NETCONF.
</t>
      <t>
Authorization of individual users via the NETCONF server may or may
not map 1:1 to other interfaces.  First, the
data models might be incompatible.  Second, it could be desirable to
authorize based on mechanisms available in the Secure Transport
layer (e.g., SSH, Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP), etc.).
</t>
      <t>
  In addition, operations on configurations could have unintended
  consequences if those operations are also not guarded by the global
  lock on the files or objects being operated upon.  For instance, if
  the running configuration is not locked, a partially complete
  access list could be committed from the candidate configuration
  unbeknownst to the owner of the lock of the candidate
  configuration, leading to either an insecure or inaccessible
  device.
</t>
      <t>
 Configuration information is by its very nature sensitive.  Its
 transmission in the clear and without integrity checking leaves
 devices open to classic eavesdropping and false data injection
 attacks.  Configuration information often contains passwords, user
 names, service descriptions, and topological information, all of
 which are sensitive.  Because of this, this protocol SHOULD be
 implemented carefully with adequate attention to all manner of attack
 one might expect to experience with other management interfaces.
      </t>
      <t>
 The protocol, therefore, MUST minimally support options for both
 confidentiality and authentication.  It is anticipated that the
 underlying protocol (SSH, BEEP, etc.) will provide for both
 confidentiality and authentication, as is required.  It is further
 expected that the identity of each end of a NETCONF session will be
 available to the other in order to determine authorization for any
 given request.  One could also easily envision additional information,
 such as transport and encryption methods, being made available for purposes of
 authorization.  NETCONF itself provides no means to re-authenticate, much
 less authenticate.  All such actions occur at lower layers. 
      </t>
      <t>
 Different environments may well allow different rights prior to and
 then after authentication.  Thus, an authorization model is not
 specified in this document.  When an operation is not properly
 authorized, a simple "access denied" is sufficient.
 Note that authorization information can be exchanged in the form of
 configuration information, which is all the more reason to ensure the
 security of the connection.
      </t>
      <t>
 That having been said, it is important to recognize that some
 operations are clearly more sensitive by nature than others.  For
 instance, &lt;copy‑config&gt; to the startup or running
 configurations is clearly not a normal provisioning operation,
 whereas &lt;edit‑config&gt; is.
Such global operations MUST disallow the changing of information
that an individual does not have authorization to perform.
For example, if user A is not allowed to configure an IP
address on an interface but user B has configured an IP address
on an interface in the &lt;candidate&gt; configuration,
user A MUST NOT be allowed to commit the &lt;candidate&gt;
configuration.
      </t>
      <t>
 Similarly, just because someone
 says "go write a configuration through the URL capability at a
 particular place", this does not mean that an element will do it without
 proper authorization.
</t>
      <t>
     The &lt;lock&gt; operation will demonstrate that NETCONF
     is intended for use by systems that have at least some trust of
     the administrator.  As specified in this document, it is possible
     to lock portions of a configuration that a principal might not
     otherwise have access to.  After all, the entire configuration is
     locked.  To mitigate this problem, there are two approaches.  It
     is possible to kill another NETCONF session programmatically from
     within NETCONF if one knows the session identifier of the
     offending session.  The other possible way to break a lock is to
     provide a function within the device's native user interface.
These two mechanisms suffer from a race condition
that could be ameliorated by removing the offending user from an
     Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)
server.  However, such a solution is not useful in all deployment
scenarios, such as those where SSH public/private key pairs are used.

error-type:     application
error-severity: error
error-info:     <ok-element> : identifies an element in the data
                  model for which the requested operation has been
                  completed for that node and all its child nodes.
                  This element can appear zero or more times in the
                  <error-info> container.

                <err-element> : identifies an element in the data
                  model for which the requested operation has failed
                  for that node and all its child nodes.
                  This element can appear zero or more times in the
                  <error-info> container.

                <noop-element> : identifies an element in the data
                  model for which the requested operation was not
                  attempted for that node and all its child nodes.
                  This element can appear zero or more times in the
                  <error-info> container.

Description:    This error-tag is obsolete, and SHOULD NOT be sent
                by servers conforming to this document.

                Some part of the requested operation failed or was
                not attempted for some reason.  Full cleanup has 
                not been performed (e.g., rollback not supported)
                by the server.  The error-info container is used
                to identify which portions of the application
                data model content for which the requested operation
                has succeeded (<ok-element>), failed (<bad-element>),
                or not been attempted (<noop-element>).

error-tag:      malformed-message
error-type:     rpc
error-severity: error
error-info:     none
Description:    A message could not be handled because it failed to
                be parsed correctly.  For example, the message is not
                well-formed XML or it uses an invalid character set.

                This error-tag is new in :base:1.1 and MUST NOT be
                sent to old clients.

 introducing unrelated changes.

        <name>Operations on Multiple Devices</name>
        <t>
 When a configuration change requires updates across a number of
 devices, care needs to be taken to provide the required transaction
 semantics. The NETCONF protocol contains sufficient primitives upon
 which transaction-oriented operations can be built.
 Providing complete transactional semantics across multiple
 devices is prohibitively expensive, but the size and number of windows
 for failure scenarios can be reduced.
        </t>
        <t>
 There are two classes of multi-device operations.  The first class
 allows the operation to fail on individual
 devices without requiring all devices to revert to their original
 state. The operation can be retried at a later time, or its failure
 simply reported to the user. An example of this class might be adding
 an NTP server. For this class of operations, failure avoidance and
 recovery are focused on the individual device. This means recovery of
 the device, reporting the failure, and perhaps scheduling another
 attempt.
        </t>
        <t>
 The second class is more interesting, requiring that the
 operation should complete on all devices or be fully reversed. The
 network should either be transformed into a new state or be reset to
 its original state. For example, a change to a VPN may require updates
 to a number of devices.  Another example of this might be adding a
 class-of-service definition. Leaving the network in a state
 where only a portion of the devices have been updated with the new
 definition will lead to future failures when the definition is
 referenced.
        </t>
        <t>
 To give transactional semantics, the same steps used in single-device
 operations listed above are used, but are performed in parallel across
 all devices. Configuration locks should be acquired on all target
 devices and kept until all devices are updated and the changes made
 permanent.  Configuration changes should be uploaded and validation
 performed across all devices.  Checkpoints should be made on each
 device.  Then the running configuration can be changed, tested, and
 made permanent. If any of these steps fail, the previous
 configurations can be restored on any devices upon which they were
 changed. After the changes have been completely implemented or
 completely discarded, the locks on each device can be released.
